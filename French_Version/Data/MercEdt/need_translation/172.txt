I can feel you're here...
My trigger finger's itchy...
Hey! Easy now...not all at the same time!
Come here...I have a soft spot for rare animals.
Did you see that? Wow, what an animal.
Well, at least they're thorough...like Jurassic Park here, eh?
What was that?
That smell's unbelievable. These animals stink like a sewer in flood.
Hear anything? Me neither. Suspicious...I don't like it.
I think they're here. Come on out, you slimeballs, I'm waitin' for you.
Dammit, there's too many of 'em!
Somethin' lyin' there.
There's somethin' here.
Hah, out of ammo! Who needs it anyway?
Dammit, I'm hit.
Janno! No! We Estonians have to stick together. You can't just die on me. Hey, I'll buy you your favorite food...

You weren't bad for a Russian, Victor.
Time for some keep fit exercises.
I just love this thing when it jams!
I've killed better guys than you.
That was tough...but I'm tougher.
Wow! I felt the draught of that bullet.
Shoot to hit a target? Are you serious?
I'm losing blood.
Got to get some shuteye before I fall asleep on my feet.
Breathe!!
Whack...haa!
One more for my collection.
Chinese make me clazy.

A real arrogant bigmouth, that Lynx.
Well, Mike, Lenni was faster, haa.
Yeh, life's a bitch...
Night missions...not one of my strong points.
Ready.
That's an order I can't accept.
I once had a girl like her.
I knew I'd be the one to get you.
There are scumbags...and scumbags.
If I hadn't listened to you Janno, I'd be somewhere nice havin' fun right now.
I'd even trust a survival camp platoon more than this damn outfit.
Air attack!
Shitty equipment really gets on my nerves.
These people have a lot to learn. They have to put more into it.
I once saw a video of Arulco. But this is different. Interesting place.
Improving all the time!
That would be counter-productive.
I saw that comin'.
You want me to cooperate with Mr. Oriental Wisdom Q himself?

Yeh, Janno. They call him "Brain", did you know that?

Victor, that was impressive. You know I'm no Russian lover, but you're OK.
I suppose you've noticed that I have Kamikaze blood in me, hm? But the way things look right now, I think I'll wait a little before I extend my contract.
No...! That's Mike!
I can't see!
No, can't do it.
Nice place, nice climate - no wonder folks in Siberia act different.
This is an enemy sector. Want to bug him a little?
This party isn't over yet.
What is that?
Nice weapon.
Is that not...Joey?
Ahem...we're honored - these Latin American freedom fighters are always so dramatic.
This sector's clean.
Who arranged this deal? I want his balls for breakfast - there's stuff missing here!
She reminded me of an old girlfriend - what was her name again...
A Bloodcat!
That was a lot of fun - and we won! It was well planned and carried out even better.
Where have they all gone? Party poopers.
I have to take a break now....
I'm back!
Me too!
This thing doesn't work.
Well, doesn't this look like a nice trap? Do I hear something ticking?
Easy...there's something on the ground there.
Dammit, I'm drowning!
I'm on site and ready.

It's no fun when someone is as incompetent like you...the answer's no.
You might be generous, but only with the lives of your own people. I don't like that at all.
My girl is ...sick. I have to take care of her.
I don't like being left hanging until the last minute. Ask me sooner next time.
This is Lennart Vilde. If you something interesting to offer, please speak after the beep tone.
Looks like we're finished here. Time to go.
Listen to Dr. Q spiritualizing the whole day long? Sorry.

There's a small problem here. If this Lynx says more than 2 words, he's dead. That's not so good for your team spirit.
Wouldn't mind extending for you...anything doing?
OK, deal.
OK, I'm hurrying.
OK, if Janno is on the team, no problem. He at least knows what he's doing...

Victor is a professional, if he's signed up, that's OK by me.
No thanks. Try somebody else. Our last mission was enough for me.
I'll say it again...
Have you had a look at your money recently?
I don't think you know what you really want.
I don't like how you treat the lives and the health of your people. You have no style.
I see Chinese dangel! Solly, I leally cannot extend my contlact.

That Lynx kills the whole mission for me. Sorry, but I think I'll look for another contract.
Hey, if Janno is on board, I am too. We make a good team.

I suppose I should know better...but if Victor stays maybe we have a chance.
I'm telling you...
Thanks for asking, but you don't expect me to work for nothing, do you?
Lennart here, hello...
A night mission...now that would be nice for my shooting skills.
What are we waiting for?
For a month, a year...what are we talking about here?
Think first - then call.
The China wonder boy and me leally don't make velly good team.

Just to remind you, my contract is soon up.
My performance has improved, so my pay has to match that. You know I'm worth it...
