Inconvenience.
The targets are here.
Ham-dog! I'm knee deep in it.
The targets are here.
This is gonna be more fun than I thought!
Jackpot! The spawning grounds. Gonna nip this right in the butt right now!
Catchin' noise.
This sucks eggs.
Step firmly! Got a bad feeling!

Ham-dog! I'm knee deep in it.
There!
What's that?
I'm dry! Need some ammo now.
Not good. Spraying blood like a keg.
Knowing Bull, he went hard.
Biff is dead? He was like a pet to me.
Gus was a good man.
Makes no sense...
Gun's jamming!
This ain't over.
Couple of drinks and I won't even remember it.
Losers.
Ain't doable. No visuals.
Got a low grade wound here.
Time to get into my bag. I'm beat...
Sucking... on a... lung.
Another one for the chaplain.
Reminds me of soup... I like soup.
Don't know what that Trevor's going on about. Couldn't give a kangaroos arse either. Just ditch him.
That Meltdown has gotta be the ugliest looking thing I ever saw. Got an urge to shoot it, myself.


He deserved to die slower, but what ya gonna do.

I'm finished up.
Hope you weren't counting on it.
Very nice! Looks like there's something to that big bang theory, after all. Well... That's what we came to do!

Somebody's child...
This sucks eggs.
Posers. Poor imitations of fighting men that's what most of 'em are.
Stay alert! Bird droppings coming our way.
Most of my stuff should be ditched in a lake.
I like it when them snobs walk around with their noses way up in the air, gives me something to aim for.

Comes with performance.
Got a stupid tag hanging from it.
Step away. Ain't nothing to see here.
He keeps blabbing away in sort of kangaroo speak. Don't know, but I'm getting away from Colby. He's giving me a tumor.
I see that thing's face again, I swear I'm gonna die. I'm puttin' some mileage between me and Meltdown. I just can't bring up any more acid.
Bull knows the ropes.
That boy makes me piss myself.
There's a man with a couple of wars under his belt.


Eyeballs are tearing. That's never happened before.
Not proud to say this, but trying is useless.
That was entertaining.
We're gonna see action here.
They're not all bagged yet. Keep that in mind.

Makes me warm inside.
Somebody's child...
Now we're both happy.
It's looks just like they were never here.
Ham-dog! What the Hell happened?
Reminds me of the lady who ran the corner store back in my old neighborhood.
Got four-legged trouble.
I get mixed feelings when these things come to an end. Get some down time, but I can't really relax unless I got a finger tugging at a trigger. Hopefully, we'll get to do it again.
Someone musta yelled fire. They made for the exits.


Count me in, too.
Fraggin' piece of ham-dog this thing!
It ain't clean. Should be careful.
Don't look right around here.

I'm standing by. Want to change that?
Computer's back in business. Can't wait to fire up a couple of my... favorite sites.
Ham-dog! What the Hell happened?
Yeah... And you'll be lucky if I let you live.
We showed up like the fourth of July. We should be making tracks.
We ain't going anywhere up here. Gotta figure a way to open that freakin' door downstairs.
Yeah... right! There's only one way out and we're going together.
Had I known we were landing in the Arctic, I would have worn my long underwear. Ham-dog! I'm freezing!
Jackpot! The spawning grounds. Gonna nip this right in the butt right now!
Grew up in a town pretty much like this...
Well, there's a good sign, my pants are filling out again. Amazing what a little bit of sun'll do.
Looks like we didn't all make it! Oh, well...
We made a lot of noise, but that's the way I like it. Gives 'em time to think about what's coming.
Looks like we didn't lose anyone to the blades.
Reminds me of the lady who ran the corner store back in my old neighborhood.
Got a loud bark for a little dog.
This is gonna be more fun than I thought!
Kid seems up-front. I trust him.
I never made it to Arulco, Manuel, but I'll do my best to see ya get back there.
Keep in check there, Colonel. Sometimes the less said the better.
Something tells me I'm gonna enjoy having you around, Kulba.
Just remember this ain't the movies, Cowboy!
Ham-dog! A new weapon to check out.
Ya know, if that buzzsaw starts up when we're in there, we're history.
He deserved to die slower, but what ya gonna do.
Gimme that paper!
Very nice! Looks like there's something to that big bang theory, after all. Well... That's what we came to do!
Looks like we didn't nip them in the butt after all. Whole country must know we're here!
Hummm. An eighteen century hand mortar with ammo. Haven't since one of those in over a month.
That's the last of 'em. What makes me think the hag's gonna be selling rugs in a month from now?
Thought I'd seen everything. Guess explosives weren't his speciality.
Only downside is raging Raul destroyed everything he was carrying, too.
Wirecutters would have been nice. Now, we gotta give this thing a good boot and let everyone know we're coming.
Look at the door. Ya gotta know someone doesn't want us in there.
I heard a loud noise coming from downstairs.
What's the deal with that alarm. Did we trigger something?
That's our cue. Fan is shutdown.
It's a list of launch coordinates for the missiles. Gives me an idea... I say, I fire off one of these suckers myself. Never had the pleasure before.
Shot it straight up and bring her straight back down. I'll program the coordinates for this place into control panel and scoot out by the elevator. Sounds like a plan to me.
