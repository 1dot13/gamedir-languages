There they are!
Are you ready?
There are too many!
One of these insects.
Tell me this is a nightmare. What does it mean if you dream of big insects?
These insects had a picnic here.
I hear something.
It stinks of these insects here.
Too much silence.
Can you feel the insects here too?
There are too many!
What is it?
Something there...!
No bullets..should I do the hand-to-hand?
I am wounded.


Merde, Barry. I am sorry..you were ok.
What, where?
My gun is out of order!
Merde!
Ummpf. I am stronger!
Mon Dieu!
This does not work.
I need help.
I will take a nap.
Ohh, air...
...see me and die...
I killed the monster.
I don't want any more of this Malice...

French tart.
Adieu Mike.
Ohlala!
You know, I am just too strong...
I am ready.
Ah non. I do not...accept this.
I had no choice...
Bye bye...
There are assholes everywhere.
Merde...
So many fools?
Air attack!
Our equipment, 'terrible'.
They have much to learn.
Zut alors...
I am better, non?
The idea is 'terrible'...
The idea was 'vraiment miserable', ehh...really bad.
I would not even ride in a bus with Malice.



Barry, that was 'formidable'!
We'll speak later.
Mike?
I'm blind!
This is impossible...
Very friendly.
Enemies in sector.
'Attention!'We are not alone.
What is that?
Like Rambo, 'n'est-ce pas'?
There...the boy...
Don't worry, we will help you...hemmm...I cannot speak so well.
They're all killed.
Something missing.
Adieu...
A Bloodcat!
I would say... victory!
Where are they? Have they all gone?
I need sleep...
I'm back.
I agree.
It does not work.
Merde, maybe it explodes?
Down there...'Attention!'
I'm drowning...
OK, I am here...

I say non, you have a bad reputation.
I say non, you loose too many men.
Merci, but no. Maybe another time.
You 'ave waited too long - I say non.
C'est Luc Fabre, please speak after peep.
I will leave now - Bonne Chance...eh...Good Luck!
Not with Malice in one team.

Avec this Florence? I regret, non...
My contract... we make an extension?
D'accord. I agree.
D'accord, I will join you.


Avec Barry together - ok... but only avec Barry.
Mon Dieu! How can you even ask? I say NON!.
I said...
And what about money?
I am leaving.
You...sacrifice your men too ...vite. Alors...I go.
Avec Malice? I say non.

I don't want to work with Flo, that's why I say non.


D'accord. I'll do it because of Barry.
I said...
You ask me...and have no money?
Hallo!
I'm the weapon of mass destruction...
Alors, what are we waiting for?
For how long?
Are you ready?
Working with Malice sucks, he's a fool.

My contract is soon....finished.
I'm more expensive now because I'm better.
