Rustlers!
I eagle-eye vermin, partner.
It be stampede, partner.
Coyote!
Ohhhhh! Very nice... Never see one of these entire life.
I do not like the look of ground. I do not like it one bit.
Hear rustling, partner. Could be rustlers.
That one a big stinker, partner.
Cock your six shooters. This Wild East situation.
Cock your six shooters. This Wild East situation.
It be stampede, partner.
Oh! Something of interest.
That belong to me now.
More lead!
I bleed like roadkill, partner.
Ahhhhh, Foxy! What happened?
Just when I happy to see Larry still alive after all these years, he go and die.

Is most confusing, partner.
Six shooter not working properly!
They will feel my horns.
One star! Great cast. Weak script. Very poor direction.
Ha! Could not hit side of a cow barn.
This no movie, partner. I cannot make shot.
I winged, partner
Plum tuckered, partner. Oh, need shut-eye.
I getting hogtied.
Dead desperado.
Take that John Wayne!




Great special effects!
I no like small places, partner. I need wide-open range.
I take care of chore.
Uh, not in contract.
Oh... Too bad I forget camera. Make excellent footage for Asia's Funniest Home Video. Now... Where did I leave that camera?
Great special effects!
That one a big stinker, partner.
This not fun like I remember.
I have big problem with posse, partner.
Galloping Clydesdale! They make attack from air!
Movie props in better condition than my stuff.

What woman doing with gun? Maybe cleaning it?
Ha! I still got it.
You no thinkin' straight, partner.
That was very, very funny, partner.


You still got it, Foxy! And you look marvelous.
Larry number one!



Feel like campfire in my eye. Hate darkness! Must see soon!
It like milking Bull. Utterly useless. Oh... I write that down in notebook.
Oh... I talk a lot with Madame Fung. Give me six string guitar, six shooter and six pack, and she be mine in less than six minutes.
There be rustlers in these parts, partner.
Be careful! They play hide and seek with us.

Take that John Wayne!
Coyote!
Most unexpected, partner.
We run Dodge city now!
In the wide-open days, partner, we'd take this rustler out back and tie to bull. Then, castrate bull. Or do way of old friend Reuban; tie bull to rustler, then castrate rustler.
This town make great location for next film project; Cow on Hot Tin Roof.
Coyote!
It was good to be back in saddle again. I be ready to hit range with you anytime, partner. I send you free movie passes for whole family entertainment.
They headed for hills, partner.


Same here, partner.
What wrong with this thing?
It big Kabooie waiting to happen, partner.
I do not like the look of ground. I do not like it one bit.

I here, partner.
Computer should be working now, partner. Remember, if anyone is looking for me, I not here. No time for fan E-mail.



Must find way to open door and go underground like prairie dog.
You not leaving me here, partner. I am CLOSET-phobic.


This town make great location for next film project; Cow on Hot Tin Roof.

Posse get caught in fan. We ride on, partner, with small posse.
Sound like earthquake. I think everyone out of bunks now, partner.
Posse make it through terrifying turbine of trouble without loss of life.
Oh, she very nice woman when you get her out of store.
In the wide-open days, partner, we'd take this rustler out back and tie to bull. Then, castrate bull. Or do way of old friend Reuban; tie bull to rustler, then castrate rustler.
You go to grave, barn-dog!
He seem like honest Abe.

You travel world, colonel. Maybe you see me in motion picture, Saving Partner Ryan. I play part of Deputy Ryan. It filmed entirely on location in Wyoming. Maybe not... Welcome to posse.

Nobody worries... I top shape! Work out everyday. Only hearing not good. Too much noise from six shooters.
Ohhhhh! Very nice... Never see one of these entire life.
Whoaaaaaaa, partner! This fan, job for stuntman double!
Commander Morris step out. He not expected to return.
Let me see poster, partner.
What a climatic closing. Ha ha! Big explosion! Much dust. They use cannons no more! We put end to that!

It classic weapon. Make excellent movie prop.

Oh... Too bad I forget camera. Make excellent footage for Asia's Funniest Home Video. Now... Where did I leave that camera?
Most unfortunate. Idiot rustler blow up everything. Nothing to pick up, but pieces!
Most unfortunate... Without wirecutters, we must break it off. It make noise, partner. Alert rustlers to our whereabouts.
Never see door so strong. It door like Fort Knox, partner.
I hear something, partner. Sound like buffalo stampede or big door moving. We should check it out.
What make terrible noise?
Fan is shutdown for maintenance. It time to ride into danger!
It explain positioning for firecrackers. Control panel offers great opportunity. I think I can send cracker on destination of choosing. This be ultimate twist to ironic plot - using threat to destroy threat.
But must determine trail for escape. Shall ride into elevator, and gallop to safety.
