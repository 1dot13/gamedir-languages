Mission is hard here. But..we come here, we win here.
Sector is like Siberian snow...clean.

We were a good team. It is right to fight here. I like this mission.
I think we are alone now.
Must rest.

I hear you hire Ivan...Me and him? Niet. You find somebody else...

I will not work with Conrad.
Contract is finished soon...you want Victor longer?
Good...Very good.
Da, accept. I will come.
Operation is not good - but if Dr. Laura with team...Victor with team, too.


I can choose my commandant. My last mission for you ...it is enough.
I say...again
I fight for money...you have not enough.
Your problem.
You let people be killed - not needed - I, Victor, will leave now.
The correct answer to question is niet. Because if yes, I will soon eat Ivan's balls for breakfast.

Niet, no extension. I wish you luck with Conrad. I only work with commandant who know a good team.
OK, I will tell you why I stay... it is only because you have Dr.Laura.


I say again...
No money, no contract.
Victor Kolesnikov here.
I live to be merc.
For what we are waiting, hah?
For how long?
You telephone with me - when you have shit again all together.
Ivan and Victor in one team - is not good...like shit and glory.

Our contract is soon finish...
More money for better merc...that is the...eh, rule.
