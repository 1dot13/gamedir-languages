Unfortunately, the 10-07 Editor build does not work for one reason or another, with the current default Data folder. I'd rather trouble shoot the new editor than spend that time fixing this one.

So, in the meantime, here are some instructions to get you going:

Instructions:

1. Revert back to a 10-07 release single Data folder (You can copy your current tabledata from \1.13-Data if you've modified it since the new release). Be sure to rename or backup your current default \Data folder before doing this.

2. A 10-07 release \Data folder is available for download below the Editor download.

2. Extract desired maps from maps.slf into \Data\Maps

3. Extract the JA2EDITOR.zip into your JA2 install directory.

4. Use the shortcut to start the map editor.


NOTE: It loads very slowly, so you may sit on a blank screen for approx. 5-10 seconds before the Sir-Tech logo appears.
