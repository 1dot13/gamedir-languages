; This options file cannot be added to without hard coding. But the settings within it can be changed as much as you want.
; By default, the values below are the values present in the 9-14-05 release of the code.

;General Guidelines:
;
;
;
;   PRICE_MODIFIER = 1-100 (Lower is better)
;
;
;   MIN_ATTRIBUTE_POINT <= START_ATTRIBUTE <= MAX_ATTRIBUTE_POINT
;
;   MIN_ATTRIBUTE_POINT < MAX_ATTRIBUTE_POINT 1-100 range
;
;   MAX_ZERO_BONUS <= MIN_ATTRIBUTE_POINT (no bug, but you can cheat by making it a larger number)
;
;   MAX_STRATEGIC_TEAM_SIZE >= 20
;
;   MAX_TRAINING_SQUAD_SIZE <= MAX_MILITIA_PER_SECTOR * 2
;
;
;   MAX_MILITIA_PER_SECTOR <= MAX_STRATEGIC_TEAM_SIZE
;
;  _MIN_ENEMY_GROUP_SIZE <= MAX_STRATEGIC_TEAM_SIZE
;
;  _ELITE_BONUS = 1-100 (percentages)
;
;  This file contains the default values from 9-14-05 version of the 1.13 MOD. If you
;  decide to change anything in this file, it's recommended that you make a backup copy
;  before you make the changes.

; TRUE Enables the ability to sell items from the sector Inventory screen with ALT-LMB option.
; FALSE Turns off the option. PRICE_MODIFIER is a divisor, 4 = 25% of the item's value. 
; Setting a value of 20 would mean 5% of the items value, and a value of 10 would mean 10%.
; Valid ranges for PRICE_MODIFIER are 1-100.

; The following values deal with the IMP merc generation, MIN_ATTRIBUTE_POINT is the lowest
; you can lower an attribute, and the lowest you can lower a skill before it hits zero.
; Max_ATTRIBUTE_POINT is of course, the opposite, the highest amount you can raise a stat to.
; IMPATTRIBUTEPOINTS is the amount of extra points you start out with when all of your stats
; and skills are set to 55. MAX_ZERO_BONUS is the amount of stat points 
; that you receive when you take a skill from 35 to Zero. Currently in the game, you lose
; 20 stat points when you do this, the skill goes from 35 to Zero and you gain 15 points in
; return. You can now change that here. START_ATTRIBUTE is the value all of your stats and skills
; start out as. Currently in game it is set to 55.

; MAX_MILITIA_PER_SECTOR defines the max number of Militia that can be trained in each sector. 
; Keep in Mind That there is not enough room on the strategic map to display more than 20
; Militia per sector correctly(could possibly change) but they will still be there to defend,
; and you can still train them, and it will still cost you.
; MAX_TRAINING_SQUAD_SIZE is the number of Militia you train at one time for the price of:
; MILITIA_TRAINING_COST which is the cost of training militia.
; MIN_LOYALTY_TO_TRAIN is the lowest loyalty a town can have and still allow you to train Militia.

; DO NOT LOWER ***MAX_STRATEGIC_TEAM_SIZE*** BELOW 20
;
; Basically the 1st set are the number of available troops the queen starts with in her
; reinforcements pool. The Second four are is How full the initial Garrisons/patrols are.
; The 3rd set are percentages of extra troops converted to ELITE by the two highest difficulty levels.
; The last set is the minimum size of an enemy group. This is the smallest group size an enemy
; wants to travel with. And this option right under the comments, this is the largest size an
; enemy can attack with at one time. And thats kind of misleading, see, two groups of 20 could
; attack you at one time, only 20 would be shown in the sector, and as you slowly kill them off
; one at a time, they are replaced until the surpluss is under 20. (Mugsy, am I understanding that
; correctly?) Anyway, the most important thing, is that you DO NOT LOWER THIS NUMBER. It can and
; will crash your game. You can however raise it, but I would raise the MAX_MILITIA_PER_SECTOR along
; with it, otherwise you may find the need for your mercs to constantly babysit militia more than they do now.

; USE_RANDOM_PERSONALITY set to TRUE will randomly generate an Attitude and a Personality for each of 
; your IMP Mercs. 
;
; CUSTOM_PERSONALITY and CUSTOM_ATTITUDE allow you to specify what personality you want for your IMP
; Merc. This option does not work with USE_RANDOM_PERSONALITY, it won't be random at all. Another Note
: before I get on with the valid settings for these two options, The INI file is NOW read at the beginning
; of the game, so if you want to pick and choose your personalities and attitudes AND use multiple IMPS, you
; Will need to save and exit the game, change the settings and then start the game back up to create the next
; IMP. I WILL FIX THIS by creating another IMP Webpage. But for now, this will have to do.
